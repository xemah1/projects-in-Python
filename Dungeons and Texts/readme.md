An only text-based game where player classes, dungeons and enemy creatures exist.

<b>v0.1</b> is playable although player progression doesn't exist. Leveling, shop and save features are to be implemented in the next update.

<b>v0.2</b> added altars so player progression is a thing now. Player earns souls when an enemy is defeated. Every 5 souls will save your life when player dies. But you may chose to spend them to level up. 
* Shop and save features are yet to be added.

<b>v0.3</b> added save feature. Cleaned up the code by a lot and changed dungeon system a little.
* Shop feature is yet to be added.
