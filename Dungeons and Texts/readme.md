An only text-based game where player classes, dungeons and enemy creatures exist.

v0.1 is playable although player progression doesn't exist. Leveling, shop and save features are to be implemented in the next update.

v0.2 added altars so player progression is a thing now. Player earns souls when an enemy is defeated. Every 5 souls will save your life when player dies. But you may chose to spend them to level up. 
* Shop and save features are yet to be added.
