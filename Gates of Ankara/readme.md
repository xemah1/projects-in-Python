v1.0 Release: Not thinking of implementing bonus buy system because the game already looks like player favored. Further investigation needed.

> v2.0 wasn't released due to critical bugs.

As of v2.2 main changes are calculations of probabilities and winnings. Total of 100 thousand cases show 176,81% RTP which is way over the wanted value. Further calculation tweaks needed.

As of v2.3 bonus game system is added with its own gimmick. Entering the bonus game from base game is possible but has a low chance. RTP percentage skyrocketed after bonus game. Further calculation tweaks have become mandatory.
> A few key values have been corrected for v2.3.1. No new file, just updated main v2.3.
> 
> Corrections have been made in mechanics when going into bonus game from default game. No new file, Just v2.3.2.

As of v2.4 I believe development of Gates of Ankara has concluded with a realistic end result. Can't exactly calculate RTP percentage due to limitations of time and resource on my end. Estimated RTP value hopefully will be posted here within 2 bussiness days.
