Minesweeper game.

There was a bug happened once that the grid had no mines. When I tried to replicate it to debug the problem it never happened again.
So zero mine "bug" may or may not happen again.

Revealing the tiles that has no adjacent mine that are adjacent to each other caused the following problem.
> RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while getting the str of an object
So I made a quick fix to create the illusion of a successful revealing algorithm. (between lines 67 and 72)
I left the recursion error causing algorithm in the code as comment. (between lines 56 and 67)
That algorithm wasn't throwing recursion error when I first coded it. It definitely needs improvement.
