I have created a sudoku creater and made it playable.
I am saying playable because originally i wanted to solve it automatically but just creating sudoku was really hard.
Playing with sudoku creater was really fun and it looked good in command prompt.(there is a comment about this in code on line 52)
!Don't run any code or file before you understand what it does.
