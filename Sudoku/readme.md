I have created a sudoku creater and made it playable.
I am saying playable because originally i wanted to solve it automatically but just creating sudoku was really hard.
!Don't run any code or file before you understand what it does.

I will add sudoku solver in this directory. (WIP)

>I saw that sudoku validator was a question in LeetCode so I solved it and now uploading it here too.
