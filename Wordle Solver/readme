This is a solver I made for the really nice word game "Wordle". I've played around with this for a quite some time and it works for almost all scenarios.

Example input for "... word you wrote: " -->ready
-Don't put any spaces before or after your five letter word

Example input for "Wordle's feedback was: " -->g g y e m
-"g" stands for green
-"y" stands for yellow
-any input other than "g" or "y" stands for black/gray/miss
-Don't press enter before you are finished with five letters

If you made a mistake just terminate the code and try again.
If I made a mistake that's unfortunate. I tried to see through every scenario but I know I haven't completely did it.

-Same letter returning two yellow feedbacks may or may not cause problem.
-Same letter returning one yellow and one gray feedback may or may not cause problem.
